# Notes on Vocabulary

Vocabulary is a design system more like Bootstrap. It allows you to add class names and have predefined styles applied to your HTML.

Vocabulary expects elements to be organised in specific ways in order for the correct style to apply.

The [official documentation](https://vocabulary-docs.netlify.app/) refers to components as Blocks and shows the context these classes should be added in.

You can locally test the repo through the files in specimen. You can also use a local version of vocabulary in other local projects by pasting the src folder into your local project, renaming it to vocabulary and linking it through your projects HTML file.

I organised the classes and their contexts in this [google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IP9llhrEWg8XK1ysjC1bUGrE0gXFr8BzJkxS838uXyE/edit?usp=sharing).

Additionally, it contains some blog posts I found about Vocabulary and some notes.

I hope this helps!
